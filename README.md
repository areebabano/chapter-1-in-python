🚀 Embarking on My Python Journey! 🐍
Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository serves as a collection of my Python learning progress, practice problems, and projects as I explore the fundamentals and beyond.

📌 What I've Covered So Far:
✅ Hello, World! – My first Python program
✅ Variables & Data Types – Storing and managing data
✅ Operators – Assignment, arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators
✅ User Input – Making programs interactive
✅ Type Conversion & Type Casting – Handling different data types
✅ Practice Problems – Applying concepts in real-world scenarios

🎯 Learning Approach
I believe that coding isn’t just about writing syntax—it’s about problem-solving and developing a logical mindset. This repository will continue to grow with more projects and challenges as I dive deeper into Python.

💡 What's Next?
🔹 Control Flow (if-else, loops)
🔹 Functions & Modules
🔹 Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
🔹 Object-Oriented Programming
🔹 Real-world projects

📖 Key Takeaway
Every expert was once a beginner! If you’re starting your coding journey, take that first step and keep building. 🚀

🙌 Special Thanks
A huge thank you to all my mentors and teachers for their support, guidance, and inspiration. Your wisdom has shaped my learning journey!
